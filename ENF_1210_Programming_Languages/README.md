# Programming Languages Term Project - Encryption Algorithms
The project consists of two tasks.\
The first task is three parts:
Firstly, a password matrix was requested to be created.  
In the second part, it is requested to encrypt the txt file that provides the given conditions.  
This password, consisting of the last ASCII characters, was requested to be deciphered.  
Note: The appropriate text file consists of a single line and only letter dots and spaces.    
The second task is:  
It includes our own unique encryption algorithm. Here we have made Caesar's encryption algorithm more complex by combining it with the matrix.  
Details are given in manual (Manual language is Turkish.)
